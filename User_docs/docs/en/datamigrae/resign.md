## Why Apps May Crash After Data Migration

macOS's code signing mechanism (`codesign`) verifies the integrity of the application package, including file path structure. When AppPorts migrates an app's data directory to external storage and replaces it with a symbolic link, the signing seal is broken, causing the following issues:

- **Gatekeeper Block**: `codesign --verify --deep --strict` detects signature failure; the system displays a "Damaged" or "from an unidentified developer" dialog, blocking app launch
- **Keychain Access Disruption**: Apps relying on Keychain access groups cannot read stored credentials due to signature identity changes
- **Entitlements Failure**: Some app entitlements are bound to the signing identity; after signature changes, entitlements mismatch

### High-Risk App Types

| App Type | Risk Level | Reason |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Sparkle self-updating apps | **High** | Updater may delete or replace the app, damaging symbolic links |
| Electron self-updating apps | **High** | `electron-updater` may also interfere with apps on external storage |
| Keychain-dependent apps | **High** | Ad-hoc signing changes the signature identity; Keychain access groups fail |
| Mac App Store apps | **High** | SIP protection; cannot be re-signed |
| Native self-updating apps (Chrome, Edge) | Medium | Self-update may replace external copy, invalidating local entry |
| iOS apps (Mac version) | Low | Uses Stub Portal or whole symlink; fewer signing issues |

### High-Risk Data Directory Types

| Data Type | Risk Level | Reason |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| `~/Library/Application Support/` | Medium | App may use file locks, SQLite WAL logs, or extended attributes; may behave abnormally across symbolic links |
| `~/Library/Group Containers/` | Medium | Shared by multiple apps under the same Team; symbolic links may interfere with other apps |
| `~/Library/Preferences/` | Low-Medium | `cfprefsd` caches plist files; symbolic links may cause reading stale data |
| `~/Library/Caches/` | Low | Caches are rebuildable; most apps handle cache absence gracefully |

## Re-signing Mechanism

### Post-Migration Re-sign Confirmation

When migrating app data under `Containers` or `Group Containers`, AppPorts asks whether to Ad-hoc re-sign the associated app after migration. Accepting backs up the original signature and re-signs the real app path after migration; declining migrates the data only.

This confirmation reduces the chance that an app fails to recognize moved container data, shows an abnormal prompt, or fails to launch after migration. For apps that rely heavily on containers or Keychain access, make an independent backup before choosing.

### Ad-hoc Signing

AppPorts uses **Ad-hoc signing** (certificate-less local signing) to fix app signatures after migration. Execution command:

```bash
codesign --force --deep --sign - <app path>
```

Where `-` indicates Ad-hoc signing (without a developer certificate).

### Signing Flow

```

### Key Steps

1. **Backup original signature identity**: Before signing, read the app's current signature identity (parse `Authority=` lines via `codesign -dvv`), save to `~/Library/Application Support/AppPorts/signature-backups/<BundleID>.plist`

2. **Clean extended attributes**: Execute `xattr -cr` to remove resource forks, Finder info, etc., avoiding "detritus not allowed" errors during signing

3. **Clean bundle root directory**: Remove `.DS_Store`, `__MACOSX`, `.git`, `.svn`, and other clutter

4. **Handle symbolic link Contents**: If `Contents/` is a symbolic link (Deep Contents Wrapper strategy), temporarily replace it with a real directory copy, then restore the symbolic link after signing

5. **Deep signing → shallow signing fallback**: Prefer `--deep` signing (covering all nested components); if it fails due to permission or resource fork issues, fall back to shallow signing without `--deep`

6. **Retry mechanism**: When `codesign` produces "internal error" or is terminated by SIGKILL, retry up to 2 times

## Signature Backup & Restore

### Linked App Path Resolution

For linked apps (status: "Linked"), signing operations automatically resolve the **real external app path** instead of the local Stub Portal shell or symlink. Resolution strategy:

| Migration Method | Resolution |
|------------------|------------|
| Whole App Symlink | Resolves the symlink target to the external real `.app` path |
| Stub Portal | Reads the real external app path recorded in the local portal |

This means backup, restore, and re-signing operations always target the real application package, ensuring signature changes take effect.

### Backup

Backup files are stored in `~/Library/Application Support/AppPorts/signature-backups/` directory, named after the **real app's** `BundleID.plist`:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `bundleIdentifier` | App's Bundle ID |
| `signingIdentity` | Original signature identity (e.g., `Developer ID Application: ...` or `ad-hoc`) |
| `originalPath` | Original app path |
| `backupDate` | Backup timestamp |

Backups are triggered at these times:

- Before data directory migration (if auto-re-signing is enabled) — uses the real app path for backup
- Before any signing operation (idempotent; does not overwrite existing backups)
- Manual "Backup Signature" action

### Restore

When restoring a signature, AppPorts executes different strategies based on the backed-up signature identity:

| Backed-up Signature Identity | Restore Behavior |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| `ad-hoc` or empty | Execute `codesign --remove-signature` to remove signature; delete backup |
| Valid developer certificate identity | Check if certificate exists in Keychain. If present, re-sign with original identity |
| Valid developer certificate identity but certificate not on this machine | **Fallback to Ad-hoc signing**; original signature cannot be fully restored |

### Restore Failure Scenarios

The following scenarios cause signature restore failure or incompleteness:

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Backup plist file does not exist | Throws `noBackupFound` error; cannot restore |
| Original developer certificate not in local Keychain | Falls back to Ad-hoc signing. App can launch but Keychain access groups and some entitlements may fail |
| Mac App Store apps (SIP protection) | Silently skipped. SIP prevents any modification to system app signatures |
| App directory not writable & root-owned | Attempts to change ownership via admin privileges. Fails if user cancels authorization prompt |
| Contents symbolic link target lost | `copyItem` fails in temporary replacement step; signing cannot be executed |
| User cancels admin authorization | Throws `codesignFailed("User cancelled authorization")` |
| Both deep and shallow signing failed | Error propagated upward; signing operation fails |

::: warning ⚠️ About Lost Developer Certificates
The most common real-world restore failure scenario is: the original app was signed by a third-party developer (e.g., `Developer ID Application: Google LLC`), but the current machine's Keychain does not have the corresponding private key. In this case, the restore operation can only generate an Ad-hoc signature; **the original signature identity cannot be fully restored**. For apps relying on specific signature identities for Keychain access groups or enterprise configuration profiles, this may cause functional anomalies.
